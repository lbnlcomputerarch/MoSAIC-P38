replaces a `include with the full include file.

args
$1 - file which has includes to be replaced
$2 - file in which output will be written
$3 - list of directories to search for includes
     (note: NON-RECURSIVE must specify all dirs)
      includes are found relative to this path
      this is equivalent to something like +incdir+
