# Chisel Wrapper for MoSAIC

Simple Chisel 6 wrapper for MoSAIC.

## Dependencies

This project can be built with the following build tools:

- [`scala-cli`](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/install) is the easiest way to build Chisel.
- [Mill](https://mill-build.com/), a modern Scala build tool that's more user friendly than SBT. The instructions for installing `mill` can be found [here](https://www.chisel-lang.org/docs/installation#mill).

## Build Verilog

### `scala-cli`

```bash
scala-cli MoSAICChisel.scala MoSAICIO.scala mosaic.scala
```

The generated SystemVerilog will be displayed to the console.

### `mill`

```bash
make verilog
```

You'll find the generated SystemVerilog in `build`.
